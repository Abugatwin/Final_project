Abugapoultry Management System (AMS) has been developed specifically for Abugapoultry, a growing poultry farm business.

- Birds: Keeping track of bird quantity and mortality rates to ensure effective management.
- Feed Management: Recording feed costs and the quantity consumed to manage resources efficiently.
- Revenue Analysis: Providing a comprehensive view of the farm's revenue trends, including both increases and decreases.
