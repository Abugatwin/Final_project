Abugapoultry Management System (AMS) has been developed specifically for Abugapoultry, a growing poultry farm business. With its creation as the final project for the Web Technologies course, the primary goal of AMS is to simplify and optimize all aspects of farm-related activities and transactions. This encompasses a wide range of functions, including managing egg sales, monitoring feed purchases, tracking egg and bird inventory, and oversight of flock production. The system is structured into distinct categories, each serving a specific purpose:

- Egg Tracking: Monitoring and recording the total number of eggs produced.
- Birds: Keeping track of bird quantity and mortality rates to ensure effective management.
- Feed Management: Recording feed costs and the quantity consumed to manage resources efficiently.
- Revenue Analysis: A comprehensive view of the farm's revenue trends, including increases and decreases.
- Sales Recording: Maintaining detailed records of all sales transactions for transparency and accountability.
This system has been designed to address the diverse operational needs of Abugapoultry, aiming to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in managing the poultry farm business.
